## Features

-   [x] Sus
-   [x] Amogus

## To Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gavkujo/susbot.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To set up the bot, first you will need a **discord bot token**. [You can refer to this article for getting your own token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/).

Then, create a `.env` file in the root folder of the bot and create a new environmental variable `DISCORD_TOKEN` for the bot token. You can refer to `.example.env` for the format.

Finally, run:

```sh
python ./bot.py
```
