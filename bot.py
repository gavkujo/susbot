Motu Patlu is a anime with the characters Motu, Patlu and the citizens of their suburban indian residence. Motu is a thicc boy-o who everybody loves because he is motu. Patlu is motu's sidekick who thinks he is such a smarty pants. Motu saves his town from the villanous John the Dohn. John is a stupid bully who picks on motu using india's own professor jhatika's gadjets against motu. Motu always wins because he is best boy-o. Like in many other animes the characters get different forms and motu patlu is no exception. Motu has many forms some including SUPER DOG MAN MOTU!, Onion Motu, Regular Motu and his final form..... He can only enter his final form when he eats a samosa his favorite snack which he eats on a frequent basis. His final form can sent someone 5x his weight flying into space and coming back down to earth! Motu then saves the day (and patlu from danger) while officer Chingnam arrests him and puts him in his jail called the web since Nobody could escape chingnam's web. In conclusion motu patlu has many elements many modern day animes don't have (I'm looking at you richard and mortimer) heart, an unstoppable duo, character arcs and development and who could forget Anime Betrayals. I give this anime 11 samosas out of 10! I am hyped for the next episode of Motu Patlu it's gonna be great!",

  "weeb": f"You will never be Japanese. You have no ancestry, you have no citizenship, you have no skills that would make Japan ever want you. You are a shut-in self-hating white man twisted by delusions of mythical Japanese superiority and exposure to Japanese media into a disgusting mockery of nature’s perfection. All 'validation' you get from other people in this position couldn't be worse in making you believe that spending years of your life learning a globally useless language to a first-grader's level was a worthwhile use of your time, but one can't expect that an individual as pathetic as you will ever know the value of the youth you threw away in doing that. Actual Japanese are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of linguistic evolution have allowed natives to identify frauds from mannerisms and vocabulary alone. Even if your written text of self-hatred and attention begging akin to a stray dog's somehow passes as normal (it won't), any Japanese person will immediately cut all ties when they hear the voice and accent of someone who is not only a basic Japanese speaker at best, but worth no more than garbage in skills, accomplishments, and likeability. You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile and laugh to yourself believing that watching a content creator that you understand 20% of at best is somehow superior than watching your own kind, as you project your disgusting traits onto your entire kind. However, deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight, and you know that. You know that all you do now is have an entirely new linguistic medium in which to be ignored, and not even the exotic trait of being foreign makes up for just how uninteresting of a person you are. yeah im talking to you, {message.author.mention}. fucking cringe weaboo",
